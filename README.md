# AI-Search-Project
Applying AI search algorithms to a 2D game environment

Run the **visualiser.py** script to observe the AI in action, after each state!

The script takes 2 command line arguments:
- input_filename, which must be a valid testcase file (e.g. one of the provided files in the testcases directory)
- output_filename, which should be the solution file written by your solver program
